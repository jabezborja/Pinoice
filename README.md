# Create some Programs #
Make sure that you always put your files in 'Program' folder or it will not be detected.

# Installation #
You can install this on your local machine.

First, you need to install Python3 first. Then add this anywhere in your computer.

To run any programs you need to run 'tagalag-console.bat' where you will type 'tag'

Then, it will ask you what is the name of the file, if your first time, it is 'program.tag' file.
